# OpenPlayer
A SecondLife sound player/looper with some fancy features

OpenPlayer, the open-source sound player.

Made by TT (titty.luv) with help from xrrawva.

V1.8 Updating updater, in preparation for another update. Woo. Also pointing to new URLs for server.

V1.7 Packed in a minified/obfuscated version that saves tones of memory, allowing for more loops to be indexed. The code however is impossible to read as a result. See https://github.com/ShrkByte/OpenPlayer for reference.

V1.6 Axed public toggle in favor of two different versions, owner and public. This saves us soooo much memory. Used some of that free memory to add GESTURE CONTROLS!

V1.5 Fixed persisent text displaying last selected rather than last played/playing. Fixed sorting stack heap collision when importing < ~400 sounds via transfer script. Added (optional) left-right scrolling click sounds.

V1.4 Re-wrote sorting method to save memory.

V1.3 Fixed a stack heap issue when sorting sound lists.

V1.2 Added an (optional) updater script, Re-made mesh to be even more modular + made script changes to reflect this, Added public toggle & Persistent song name toggle. Included a neat transfer script to help with transfering sounds between items.

V1.1: Added: Stop notification, Made linkable.

v1: Initial release!

INFO: This sound player was created to replace other similar closed-source players, and to
      provide people with maximum customizability!
      Everything in this script is open source, and made FREE for everyone. If you see someone
      trying to sell this script, let me know. Because that's pretty lame.

NOTE: Replacing textures, tinting and moving elements around = just fine. The player should have
been packed with the original textures for reference if you want to make your own.
There are some basic things you can change at the top of the script to change a few
features of the player, but beyond that you need to dive in a little more.
There is a minimum requirement of 4 sounds for the text to display correctly. Yeah I got
lazy. It's open source though, so FIX IT!!

INSTRUCTIONS: Throw sounds/loops into the inventory, the player does the rest.
You can alter the volume / playback mode by clicking on the settings icon.
You can scroll through songs by clicking and holding, while making circular
motions in the direction you wish to scroll.
You can also click left/right sides of the player to scroll through slowly.

Keep it free, pass it around, have fun.
